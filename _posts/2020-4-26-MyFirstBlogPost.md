title: My first blog post!

__Hello reader!__
<br />
<br />
This is my first blog post here. In this blog you're going to find (eventually and hopefully) a lot of technical stuff, ranging from mathematics to programming to machine learning. There are two reason for me starting this blog:

1. I want to confirm my understanding on a subject by writing a post on it.
2. If there are any readers here, you may learn something and get new ideas.

I want to clarify that I'm not going to write about _everything_ I learn here, not even close. There might be periods I write more and then there might be months where I don't write anything. If I don't write anything for a long time, it doesn't mean that I'm dead, but instead that I don't have anything to write about, or I don't have time, or I just don't want  to write because I see no reason in it.
<br />
Anyways, I hope that I'll have time to write another post soon, but until then, take care!
